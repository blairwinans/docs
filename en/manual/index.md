## Manual for version <docrobot_current_version>

<docrobot_message type="info"><p>Welcome to the manual page of Isotope eCommerce. As you can see there's unfortunately little in English yet. We have an extensive one in German and it is all managed via <a href="https://github.com/isotope/docs">GitHub</a>. If you are an Isotope eCommerce and Contao user, you might it find an easy one translating the content with the help of Google Translate or similar tools. We'd love to hear from you and appreciate any support we can get from the English speaking community!</p></docrobot_message>
